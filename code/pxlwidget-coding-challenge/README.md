## Case Study 1 : Anagram Finder

create a program that takes a list of any number of strings and will
determine which words in the list are exact anagrams of each other (ignoring spaces). For example, if the
input to the program is:
[
'rope',
'pore',
'repo',
'red rum',
'murder',
'listen',
'silent',
'endeavour',
]
The output should be:
[
['rope', 'pore', 'repo'],
['red rum', 'murder'],
['listen', 'silent'],
['endeavour'],
]

## What's Anagram

> A word is said to be an anagram of another when it can be formed
> by rearranging the letters of the other word
> each letter just once.
> E.g listen is an anagram of silent

## The Challenge

Dillinger uses a number of open source projects to work properly:
And of course Dillinger itself is open source with a [public repository][dill]
on GitHub.

## Algorithmic Thinking

Dillinger requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v10+ to run.
Install the dependencies and devDependencies and start the server.

## Code Implementation

Dillinger is currently extended with the following plugins.
Instructions on how to use them in your own application are linked below.
